# data_structure
## Part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/data-structures-and-algorithms)

### Project 1: Binary Tree with BFS and DFS.
### Project 2: Knight Moves
#### first_attempt.rb shows my initial attempt at a solution, but I inevitably
#### hit a wall with how to store the information. I decided to get some better help with existing solutions.
#### test.rb shows my attempt at trying to figure out how to store the moves.
#### thanks to dstodolny for a very clean and clear solution that managed to properly convey what I was thinking
#### but couldn't quite put together on my own.
